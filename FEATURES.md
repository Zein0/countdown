### Data Models

**CountdownEvent**:
```typescript
{
  id: string                    // nanoid generated
  title: string
  emoji?: string
  dateTime: string             // ISO 8601
  mode: 'countdown' | 'countup'
  quote?: string
  mood: 'Hopeful' | 'Melancholy' | 'Peaceful' | 'Silent'
  pinned: boolean
  backgroundColor?: string
  backgroundImage?: string | null
  format: 'relative' | 'precise' | 'seconds'
  createdAt: string           // ISO 8601
  progressEnabled: boolean
  premiumFeatureUsed: boolean
  notificationIds?: string[]
}
```

### Persistence Strategy

- **AsyncStorage**: All events and settings persisted locally
- **Zustand Middleware**: Automatic persistence with version migration support
- **Widget Storage**: Separate expo-widget storage for active widget event
- **No Cloud Sync**: All data stays on device

### Widget Implementation

- **Widget Kind**: `stillness.countdown`
- **Update Strategy**: Single event at a time can be synced to widget
- **Data Flow**: App â†’ expo-widget storage â†’ iOS widget
- **Families**: systemSmall, systemMedium
- **Lock Screen**: Enabled via `supportsLockScreen: true`

## User Experience Flow

1. **First Launch**: Empty state with candle emoji and call-to-action
2. **Create Event**: FAB â†’ Event form with all customization options
3. **Browse Feed**: Events sorted by pinned status, then chronological
4. **View Detail**: Tap event â†’ Full-screen detail with live countdown
5. **Set Widget**: Premium users tap "Widget" â†’ Event synced to home screen
6. **Edit/Delete**: Edit screen accessible from detail view
7. **Settings**: Configure notifications, theme, premium status

## Platform Support

- **iOS**: Full support (primary platform)
- **Android**: Configuration exists but not optimized (no widget support)
- **Web**: Not supported

## Known Limitations

1. Widget updates depend on iOS system refresh intervals (not every second)
2. Only one event can be displayed on the widget at a time
3. iOS notification limit (64) not enforced in scheduling logic
4. Premium unlock is a local toggle (no payment integration)
5. No iCloud sync or backup functionality
6. No recurring events or event templates
7. Light theme toggle exists but doesn't change UI

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

- [ ] Multiple widget support (different sizes showing different events)
- [ ] Widget configuration UI (select which event without opening app)
- [ ] Event templates for common countdowns (birthdays, holidays)
- [ ] Categories/tags for events
- [ ] Event history and analytics
- [ ] Export/import functionality
- [ ] iCloud sync
- [ ] Interactive widgets (iOS 17+)
- [ ] Live Activities for active countdowns
- [ ] Soundscapes implementation
- [ ] Calendar integration
- [ ] Siri shortcuts
- [ ] Apple Watch complications

## Premium Monetization Strategy

Currently implemented as a boolean toggle in settings. Intended monetization approach:

- One-time purchase or subscription model
- Unlocks: 2 additional moods, custom backgrounds, widget placement
- Placeholder for future audio features (soundscapes)
